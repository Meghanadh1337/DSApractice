```




## Configuration File

Create a file named `application.properties` with the following content:

properties

# MongoDB Configuration

```
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
```

 # Twilio Configuration
```
twilio.account.sid=your_account_sid

### 📦Usage
### Schedule Messages
The application is configured to send a random DSA question daily at 9 AM. You can adjust the schedule in the MessageScheduler class.
### Check Logs
Monitor your Twilio dashboard to see message logs and statuses.
### API Endpoints

- **Search by Tags**: GET /api/questions/searchByTags?tags={tag1}&tags={tag2}
## 📄 How It Works
1. **Twilio Integration**: The application uses Twilio's API to send WhatsApp messages. It sends a random DSA question daily to a specified phone number.
2. **Spring Boot**: Manages scheduling, message handling, and API endpoints.
3. **MongoDB**: Stores questions and user data, ensuring efficient data retrieval and management.
## 🔧 Customization
- **Change the Schedule**: Modify the cron expression in MessageScheduler to adjust when messages are sent.
- **Update Questions**: Add or modify questions in the questions array within the MessageScheduler` class.
## 🧪 Testing
Ensure that the application is running and your Twilio account is properly set up. Use the provided API endpoints to test searching functionality. Verify that reminders and questions are sent as expected.
